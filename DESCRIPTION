Description: This package allows a user to create phantom variables, which are variables that were not observed, for the purpose of sensitivity analyses for structural equation models. The package makes it easier for a user to test different combinations of covariances between the phantom variable(s) and observed variables. The package may be used to assess a model's or effect's sensitivity to temporal bias (e.g., if cross-sectional data were collected) or confounding bias.
